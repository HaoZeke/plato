An e-ink display is make of microcapsules (30-70 Î¼m in diameter), filled with black and white pigment chips and a clear fluid.

The white pigment are positively charged, the black pigments negatively.

There are electrodes under and above each capsule.

Applying a current to the electrodes will make the pigments move towards the top or the bottom of the capsule (the motion of a chip depends on its polarity and the polarity of the electrodes). Once the current is interrupted, the pigments will stay still.

The pigments that are on top will determine the perceived gray level of a screen dot.
